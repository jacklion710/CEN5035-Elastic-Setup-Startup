> ** Do not use SSO to register with your FAU id.  Give it your FAU id and makeup a password **

Once registered, make sure you copy the elastic userid and password.
Userid will be `elastic`

Also, capture the Elastic server endpoint by going to Manage and then down in the list of applications,
look for Elasticsearch and then click on `Copy endpoint`.  Use that for your server url.

On this same page, you can get the Cloud ID.  Which of these you use depends on which Client configuration sample you use.
